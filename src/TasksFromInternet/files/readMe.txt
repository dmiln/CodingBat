The two-part Introduction to Java programming tutorial is meant 
for software developers who are new to Java technology. 
Work through both parts to get up and running with object-oriented programming (OOP) 
and real-world application development using the Java language and platform.
This first part is a step-by-step introduction to OOP using the Java language. 
The tutorial begins with an overview of the Java platform and language, 
followed by instructions for setting up a development environment consisting 
of a Java Development Kit (JDK) and the Eclipse IDE. After you're introduced 
to your development environment's components, you begin learning basic Java syntax hands-on.
Part 2 covers more-advanced language features, including regular expressions, 
generics, I/O, and serialization. Programming examples in Part 2 build on the Person 
object that you begin developing in Part 1.
